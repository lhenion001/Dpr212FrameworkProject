## Project Title:
Android Application called "PassBook"
## Project Information:
This project is a password application called "PassBook" created using Android Studio Framework and JAVA. The purpose of this application is to allow users to safely store  of any online account they have by allowing them to store the name of the online account/website name, username, and password for each account they have. This is a convenient and better alternative to just writing this information down on a random piece of paper or just trying to remember it, only to lose it when you actually need it. It is also a helpful tool because it eliminates the hassle of having to reset your password everytime your forget it, which tends to happen when you really need to login to access your account(s) for something important such as paying a credit card bill, or a medical bill, or when
you need to login to your college website to access any homework assignments, dates of upcoming exams, important class emails or reminders, college emergencies, etc.
